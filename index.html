	<h3>I was born in a city within a city called Kenner, Louisiana. By the age of three we moved out of that house due to what parents said, "The house is shrinking!" That was when we moved to what is known as "the North Shore" because, well, it's north side of Lake Pontchatrain. We continued to live in that house for the following 19 years. I've learned how to play piano, guitar, drums, basically anything I could get my hands on. Musical instruments as well as technology has always grabbed my interest. It wasn't until the begginning of this year until I found that developing is a new love and passion of mine.</h3>
